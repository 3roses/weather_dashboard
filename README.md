# weather_dashboard

I created a webpage that takes displays current weather, as well as a 5 day forecast for a city that the user inputs.
The event listener fires off a series of functions. The webpage fetches data from a weather API and displays information about
the current weather in a large display section. Then the latitude and longitude coordinates from this fetch are used to fetch new weather
data that is then displayed in cards for each of the next 5 days. The user's recent searches are stored in an array in local storage and 
displayed underneath the input field.
